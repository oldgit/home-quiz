    The first two are:

Got it?'* What **name** does he give this martini? (1 Point)

1. Butter, flour and milk.
2. Cheese - typically grated Gruyere but also Emmental or white cheddar. 
3. A hot and sour (1 point) soup (1 point) with prawns (1 point).
4. Kimchi.
5. Harvey Wallbanger
6. Three higher grades of Cognac:
    - **Napoléon** designates a blend in which the youngest brandy is aged for at least six years
    - **XO** (Extra Old) The minimum age of the youngest brandy used in an XO blend was increased to 10 years in April 2018;
      this rule was originally scheduled for implementation in 2016, but was postponed due to inadequate stocks.
      The Napoleon designation, previously unofficial, is used to specifically denote those
      blends with a minimum age of six years that do not meet the revised XO definition.
    - **Hors d'âge** (Beyond Age) is a designation which BNIC states is equal to XO,
      but in practice the term is used by producers to market a high-quality product beyond the official age scale.
7. Vesper - named after Vesper Lynd (played by Eva Green in the 2006 film adaption).
8. 2 and a half imperial pints. 5 seconds.
