# Welcome to @Home Quiz

This is a website to host quiz questions and answers at: <https://oldgit.github.io/home-quiz/>

Files are written in [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/oldgit/home-quiz/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

The quiz questions, answers and scores are all considered Jekyll [posts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/) and are stored as markdown files with a date prefix, eg. '2020-05-12' and a '.md' suffix in the directory: [\_posts](\_posts/)
