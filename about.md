This is a website to host quiz questions and answers.

The quizzes are listed by date on the [homepage](../).

A quiz is written as a file in [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

Files are stored in the github repository: [home-quiz](https://github.com/oldgit/home-quiz)

On a commit to this repository, [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) will 
run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in the site, 
from the content in the Markdown files.
